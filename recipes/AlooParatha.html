    <h1>Aloo Paratha</h1>
    <p>
        One of the most repeated breakfast in my home is aloo paratha.
         Everyone loves it. Piping-hot crisp wheat flatbreads stuffed with spiced,
          faintly sour mashed potatoes 
        stuffing and relished with some tangy sour
         mango pickle. What is not to love about aloo paratha?
